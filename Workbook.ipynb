    "### Project Description:\n",
    "Using the dataset I found on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/diegobabativa/depression I will be analyzing a data set that includes stats on people with depression. \"The data was consists as a study about the life conditions of people who live in rurales zones. Because all the columns were not explicated in this challenge so We canÂ´t understand them. We proceded to delete them or ignoring.\" - This is in the description of the kaggle data set. It is in broken english, but I can see that it is saying these stats are from people in rural areas, and has also been cleaned.\n",
